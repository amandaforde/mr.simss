#' mr.simss: Mendelian Randomisation (MR) method that combats Winner's Curse using a simulated sample splitting approach
#'
#' A package designed to provide users with a method, namely **MR-SimSS**, which uses simulated sample splitting in order to alleviate
#' *Winner's Curse* bias in MR causal effect estimates. This approach also takes into account sample overlap between the exposure and outcome genome-wide association studies. It
#' uses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and works in combination with existing MR methods, such as IVW and MR-RAPS.
