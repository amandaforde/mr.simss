<span style="color:darkblue;">What is <em>Winner’s Curse</em>
bias?</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-winners-curse-bias"></a>
</h4>
<p>As stated in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010546" class="external-link">Forde
<em>et al.</em> (2023)</a>, it has been observed that in general, the
effect size of a genetic variant tends to be lower in a replication
study than in the GWAS that discovered the variant-trait association.
This observation is due to the phenomenon known as <em>Winner’s
Curse</em>. In the context of a single association study, the term
<em>Winner’s Curse</em> describes how the <strong>estimates of
association strength for genetic variants that have been deemed most
significant are very likely to be exaggerated</strong> compared with
their true underlying values. A more detailed description of the
<em>Winner’s Curse</em> phenomenon, especially with respect to genetic
association studies, can be found <a href="https://amandaforde.github.io/winnerscurse/" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Winner’s Curse</em> bias can have many practical consequences,
most notably affecting techniques which are reliant on variant-trait
association estimates obtained from GWASs. Thus, as Mendelian
Randomization (MR) is a statistical framework which uses genetic
variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to estimate the magnitude of
the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome, <strong><em>Winner’s
Curse</em></strong> <strong>bias can prove problematic in the MR
setting.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>

<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="how-and-why-does-winners-curse-bias-affect-mr-causal-effect-estimates">
<span style="color:darkblue;">How and why does <em>Winner’s
Curse</em> bias affect MR causal effect estimates?</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-and-why-does-winners-curse-bias-affect-mr-causal-effect-estimates"></a>
</h4>
<p>In order to correctly determine the causal effect of an exposure on
an outcome, an MR study requires certain essential IV conditions to be
met. The first IV condition, namely instrument relevance, states that
the <strong>genetic variants used as instruments must be robustly
associated with the modifiable exposure</strong> (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629615001198" class="external-link">Von
Hinke <em>et al.</em> (2016)</a>). Thus, in order to ensure that this
condition is satisfied, MR practitioners typically choose genetic
variants for use in the study if statistical evidence suggests that the
variants are strongly associated with the exposure. In a summary-level
MR framework, it is therefore most common practice to <strong>select
genetic instruments according to their exposure GWAS summary data and an
imposed selection criterion</strong>, i.e. typically genetic variants
with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values less than <span class="math inline">\(5 \times 10^{-8}\)</span> in the exposure
GWAS.</p>
<p><em>Winner’s Curse</em> arises in an MR investigation when there
exists <strong>sample overlap between the GWAS used to select
instruments and the GWASs used to estimate the instrument-exposure and
instrument-outcome associations</strong> (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/52/4/1209/6961569?login=false" class="external-link">Jiang
<em>et al.</em> (2022)</a>), i.e. a certain portion of individuals are
used for both selection and estimation purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Firstly, if the <strong>discovery study</strong>, the GWAS used to
choose suitable genetic instruments, also <strong>supplies the
variant-exposure association estimates</strong> used in the MR analysis,
then due to <em>Winner’s Curse</em>, overestimation of the effect of the
genetic instruments relative to the exposure is likely to occur. A
<u><span style="color:darkblue;"><strong>deflation</strong></span>
<strong>in the overall MR causal effect estimate</strong></u> is
subsequently incurred. Many common MR methods combine the Wald ratio
estimates of multiple variants to provide an overall causal effect
estimate. Therefore, if <em>Winner’s Curse</em> bias exists in the
denominators of the Wald ratio estimates, i.e. the estimated genetic
associations with the exposure, each variant-specific ratio estimate
will be subject to downward bias in the direction of the null, and so
too will the final MR estimate.
</li>
<li>
Even though the severity of <em>Winner’s Curse</em> bias will generally
be greatest with respect to the associations with the trait used for
variant selection purposes, i.e. the exposure, associations with another
trait, correlated with the exposure, can also be affected. As the
exposure and the outcome tend to be associated due to confounding, this
means that if the <strong>same set of individuals are used in the
discovery study as in the GWAS used to obtain the variant-outcome
association estimates</strong>, these estimates will also likely be
exaggerated. In this instance, in which the variant-outcome association
estimates used in the MR analysis are biased due to <em>Winner’s
Curse</em>, the resulting <u><strong>MR estimate will likely be</strong>
<span style="color:darkblue;"><strong>inflated</strong></span></u>.

<em>Winner’s Curse</em> on MR estimates</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#empirical-evidence-for-the-impact-of-winners-curse-on-mr-estimates"></a>
</h4>
<p>Motivated by the fact that the effect of <em>Winner’s Curse</em>,
with respect to MR studies, remained unclear, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/52/4/1209/6961569?login=false" class="external-link">Jiang
<em>et al.</em> (2022)</a> performed an empirical investigation into the
impact of <em>Winner’s Curse</em> on MR estimates, by considering the
<strong>effect of BMI on coronary artery disease risk</strong>. In their
work, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/52/4/1209/6961569?login=false" class="external-link">Jiang
<em>et al.</em> (2022)</a> noted that in practice, <em>Winner’s
Curse</em> is most consequential for MR when it impacts genetic
association estimates with the outcome. In this case, the resulting
inflation in the causal effect estimate can potentially lead to a false
positive finding. However, the magnitude of bias induced by <em>Winner’s
Curse</em> in estimated variant-outcome associations was witnessed to be
much lower than that in the variant-exposure associations. Despite this,
the <strong>potential of</strong> <strong><em>Winner’s
Curse</em></strong> <strong>to substantially bias MR estimates was
clearly demonstrated</strong>. In fact, it has also been shown
separately that <em>Winner’s Curse</em> can greatly <strong>magnify the
extent of weak instrument bias</strong> in MR analyses (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259622v1.full" class="external-link">Sadreev
<em>et al.</em> (2021)</a>).</p>

typically avoided in summary-level MR studies?</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-is-winners-curse-bias-typically-avoided-in-summary-level-mr-studies"></a>
</h4>
<p>Several methods have been published which aim to correct
variant-trait association estimates for <em>Winner’s Curse</em> bias, as
described in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010546" class="external-link">Forde
<em>et al.</em> (2023)</a>. Unfortunately, in practice, incorporation of
such approaches into MR investigations has been rarely seen in the
literature. In fact, the most common recognised solution to <em>Winner’s
Curse</em> in summary-level MR analyses is simply the employment of a
<span style="color:darkblue;"><strong>‘three-sample’
design</strong></span>, in which <strong>three independent
non-overlapping data sets are used to select instrument variants,
estimate variant-exposure associations and estimate variant-outcome
associations</strong> (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/52/4/1209/6961569?login=false" class="external-link">Jiang
<em>et al.</em> (2022)</a>). For instance, <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-48/issue-3/Statistical-inference-in-two-sample-summary-data-Mendelian-randomization-using/10.1214/19-AOS1866.full" class="external-link">Zhao
<em>et al.</em> (2020)</a> suggest that <em>Winner’s Curse</em> bias
should be dealt with ‘by requiring use of an independent dataset for IV
selection’. However, it can be <strong>difficult to obtain three large
non-overlapping GWAS data sets, that are sufficiently similar</strong>
with respect to participant characteristics. In addition, potentially
<strong>splitting a large exposure data set</strong> in two may be
undesirable as it <strong>reduces the power</strong> to both detect
suitable instruments and estimate their associations with the
exposure.</p>

<span style="color:darkblue;">What is weak instrument

</h4>
<p>A <u><strong>weak instrument</strong></u> is a valid IV that
perfectly satisfies the core IV conditions, but only <strong>explains a
small fraction of variation in the exposure</strong> and thus, the
strength of the statistical association between this instrument and the
exposure is seen as ‘weak’ (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.4197" class="external-link">Burgess
and Thompson (2011)</a>). For such an instrument, it is likely that
<strong>chance associations of the instrument with confounding factors
are responsible for a sizeable proportion of the observed
instrument-exposure association</strong>. If genetic variants that are
weakly associated with the exposure are used as instruments in an MR
analysis, this will result in a non-trivial form of bias, namely
<u><strong>weak instrument bias</strong></u>, being introduced into the
causal effect estimation.</p>

<span style="color:darkblue;">How does weak instrument bias impact
MR causal effect estimates?</span><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-does-weak-instrument-bias-impact-mr-causal-effect-estimates"></a>
</h4>
<p>The bias induced into the MR causal effect estimate, arising from the
use of weak instruments, <strong>varies in magnitude and direction
according to the extent of overlap</strong> between the exposure and
outcome sample sets (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.6835" class="external-link">Burgess
<em>et al.</em> (2016)</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>
In a <strong>one-sample</strong> MR setting, in which a single
<strong>fully overlapping sample</strong> is used to estimate the
genetic associations with the exposure and the outcome, these chance
correlations with confounders have a related impact on association
estimation with respect to both the exposure and outcome. The
incorporation of weak instruments thus <u><strong>biases the causal
effect estimate</strong> <span style="color:darkblue;"><strong>towards
the confounded observational exposure-outcome
association</strong></span></u> (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.4197" class="external-link">Burgess
and Thompson (2011)</a>), likely increasing the risk of Type I error (<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/t0284" class="external-link">Stock and Yogo (2002)</a>).
</li>
<li>
On the contrary, for a <strong>two-sample</strong> MR analysis, in which
variant-exposure and variant-outcome associations are estimated using
<strong>two non-overlapping samples</strong>, the chance confounder
correlations influence these associations independently. Weak instrument
<u><strong>bias will then be witnessed to act in the</strong> <span style="color:darkblue;"><strong>direction of the
null</strong></span></u> (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/178/7/1177/211774" class="external-link">Pierce and
Burgess (2013)</a>).
</li>
</ol>
<p>As the former of these two versions of bias can greatly increase the
risk of Type I error, <strong>many investigators favour two-sample MR
analyses</strong> to circumvent incurring such an error. In addition,
the <strong>majority of MR summary-level methods have been designed
according to an assumption that the variant-exposure and variant-outcome
association estimates have been produced by independent GWASs</strong>.
However, as highlighted by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gepi.21998" class="external-link">Burgess
<em>et al.</em> (2016)</a>, with respect to a population of interest,
the largest outcome and exposure GWAS have generally been carried out by
a large GWAS consortium and thus, there may be a substantial number of
individuals common to both GWAS data sets. Given this, taking a
two-sample approach and restricting analyses to GWASs with zero overlap
often leads to inefficient resource usage and reduced statistical
power.</p>
<p><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="math inline">\(\star\)</span></span> <strong>Note:</strong> In a
summary-level MR study in which the samples are only partially
overlapping, the weak instrument bias introduced will be some form of
compromise between the two aforementioned extremes. Interestingly, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gepi.21998" class="external-link">Burgess
<em>et al.</em> (2016)</a> demonstrated that this <strong>bias is in
fact linearly related to the fraction of sample overlap</strong> between
the two data sets used to perform the exposure and outcome GWASs.</p>

</h3>
<p>The various ways in which both <em>Winner’s Curse</em> and weak
instrument bias can impact the MR causal effect estimate are summarized
in the image below. The coloured circles, i.e. <span style="color: #1b9e77;"><strong>circle A</strong></span>, <span style="color: #d95f02;"><strong>circle B</strong></span> and <span style="color: #7570B3;"><strong>circle C</strong></span>, represent
three sufficiently similar large independent samples in which
association studies have been performed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For instance, the first row describes a setting in which the
association study performed on <span style="color: #1b9e77;"><strong>sample A</strong></span> is used to
<strong>select the genetic instruments</strong> for the MR study and to
<strong>estimate <u>both</u> variant-exposure and variant-outcome
associations</strong>. Here, as the same study is used to select
variants and obtain variant-exposure association estimates, these
variant-exposure association estimates will suffer from <em>Winner’s
Curse</em> bias. Similarly, as the same study is also used to select
variants and obtain variant-outcome association estimates, the
variant-outcome associations will also be overestimated due to
<em>Winner’s Curse</em> bias. This means that as a result of
<strong><em>Winner’s Curse</em></strong> <strong>in both sets of
association estimates</strong>, the final MR causal effect estimate will
be subject to both an <strong>inflation and deflation</strong>, of
likely differing magnitudes. In addition, as the same study is used to
estimate variant-exposure and variant-outcome associations, the
<strong>weak instrument bias will act in the direction of the confounded
observational exposure-outcome association</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final row depicts the <span style="color:darkblue;"><strong>‘three-sample’ design</strong></span>
scenario, in which <span style="color: #1b9e77;"><strong>sample
A</strong></span> is used to <strong>select the genetic
instruments</strong> for the MR study, <span style="color:#d95f02;"><strong>sample B</strong></span> provides the
<strong>variant-exposure association estimates</strong> and the
<strong>variant-outcome associations</strong> are estimated using <span style="color: #7570B3;"><strong>sample C</strong></span>. As there is no
sample overlap between the dataset used for selection purposes and the
datasets used for estimation, neither the variant-exposure association
estimates nor the variant-outcome association estimates suffer from
<em>Winner’s Curse</em> bias. Furthermore, as the sample used to
estimate the variant-exposure and the sample used to estimate the
variant-outcome are non-overlapping/independent, the <strong>weak
instrument bias will be towards the null</strong>.</p>
